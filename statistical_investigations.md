# Statistical Investigations


The six steps of statistical investigation

1. Ask a research question (Research hypothesis)
2. Design a study and collect data
3. Explore the data
4. Draw Inferences (Logic of inference: significance, estimation)
5. Formulate conclusions (Scope of inference: generalizaion, causation)
6. Look back and ahead

The Four Pillars of Inference: Strength, Size, Breadth and Cause

Forom p. 31

significance

: How *strong* is the evidence of an effect?

estimation

: How *large* is the effect?

generalization

: How *broadly* do the conclusions apply?

causation

: Can we say what *caused* the observed difference?



Covers *all* four principals using a single binary variable, single mean
Then it covers:

    - Two proportions
    - Comparing two means
    - Paired data: One quantitative variable
    - More than two proportions
    - More than two means
    - Two quantitative variables: correlation coefficient, regression

For most of these it covers a simulation based approach, then a theory based approach
