**Work in Progress, this will be updated before (and during) the quarter**

# Learning Objectives

Learning Objectives will be similar to Cetinkaya-Rundel [https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring15/sta101.001/syllabus/](Stat 101):

- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
- Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
- Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
- Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
- Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.
- Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.
- Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
- Complete a research projects applying the quantitative methods used in this course


# Research Project

Choosing a research project.
Every student in this class will execute their own statistical analysis of a research question, from data collection, to analysis, to presentation. If you developed a research design for POLS 500, you may be able to use it in 501.
However you need to confirm that you will be able to assemble a dataset to test a specific research hypothesis within the time constraints of this course.
If that seems unlikely, you will need to choose a different project.
We will be discussing some additional data/research opportunities.

# Evaluation

Evaluation will consist of a combination of assignments, and a project.
