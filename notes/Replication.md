# APSR

Follows the ASPA Guide an 

> If your manuscript contains quantitative evidence and analysis, you should describe your procedures in sufficient detail to permit reviewers to understand and evaluate what has been done and -- in the event the article is accepted for publication - to permit other scholars to replicate your results and to carry out similar analyses on other data sets. With surveys, for example, provide sampling procedures, response rates, and question wordings; calculate response rates according to one of the standard formulas given by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. For experiments, provide full descriptions of experimental protocols, methods of subject recruitment and selection, payments to subjects, debriefing procedures, and so on. In any case involving human subjects, the editors may require certification of appropriate institutional review and/or conformity with generally accepted norms. 

> The strength of evidence necessary for publication of quantitative empirical findings cannot be captured by any single criterion, such as the conventional .05 level of statistical significance. The journal's co-editors -- following the evolving disciplinary standard among reviewers -- will evaluate the strength of findings on a range of criteria beyond statistical significance, including substantive significance, theoretical aptness, the importance of the problem under study, and the feasibility of obtaining additional evidence. (See code of ethics.)

> In addition, authors of quantitative or experimental articles are expected to address the issue of data availability. You must normally indicate both where (online) you will deposit the information that is necessary to reproduce the numerical results and when that information will be posted (such as "on publication" or "by [definite date]"). You should be prepared, when posting, to provide not only the data used in the analysis but also the syntax files, specialized software, and any other information necessary to reproduce the numerical results in the manuscript. Where an exception is claimed, you should clearly explain why the data or other critical materials used in the manuscript cannot be shared, or why they must be embargoed for a limited period beyond publication.

> ...

> Articles should be self-contained; you should not simply refer readers to other publications for descriptions of these basic research procedures. Please indicate variables included in statistical analyses by italicizing the entire name of the variable -- the first time it is mentioned in the text -- and by capitalizing its first letter in all uses. You should also use the same names for variables in text, tables, and figures. Do not use acronyms or computational abbreviations when discussing variables in the text. All variables that appear in tables or figures should have been mentioned in the text, standard summary statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, range, etc.) provided, and the reason for their inclusion discussed. However, tables and figures should also be comprehensible without reference to the text, e.g., in any figures, axes should be clearly labeled. Please bear in mind also that neither the published or online versions of the Review normally can provide figures in color; be sure that a grayscale version will be comprehensible to referees and readers.

# AJPS

All figures, tables, and supporting information must be placed at the end of the manuscript. One figure or table should appear per page. Markers should be placed in the text to indicate the locations of figures and tables (e.g., “Figure 1 about here”, etc.).

On replication: [AJPS Guidelines for Preparing Replication Files](https://ajpsblogging.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ajps-guide-for-replic-materials-1-0.pdf)

> The author of an accepted manuscript must provide replication materials that are sufficient to enable interested researchers to reproduce all of the analytic results that are reported in the text and supporting materials. The document titled “American Journal of Political Science Guidelines for Preparing Replication Files” provides useful information about what information is needed and how it should be organized. All replication files must be stored in a Dataset within the AJPS Dataverse, located on the Harvard Dataverse Network. The document titled “American Journal of Political Science Quick Reference for Uploading Replication Files” provides information about creating a Dataset on the AJPS Dataverse and depositing materials into it. Note that authors also can make their replication files available elsewhere (e.g., their personal website, other data repositories, etc.) as long as all of the necessary files are included in the Dataset on the AJPS Dataverse.
> The author should prepare and upload replication materials before submitting the final draft of the accepted manuscript. The “American Journal of Political Science Data Verification Checklist” is designed to help authors ensure that they have provided all necessary files. When the final draft is submitted, the replication materials will be verified to confirm that they do, in fact, reproduce the analytic results reported in the article. The verification process is carried out by the Archive Staff at the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Immediately after successful verification, the Odum staff will release the Dataset for public access and the AJPS Editorial Staff will forward the final draft of the manuscript to the publisher for copyediting, production, and publication .

> The final draft of the manuscript must be in MS Word or LaTeX format. Manuscripts submitted in MS Word format usually are sent as a single file. If the manuscript is submitted in LaTeX format, then be sure to include all related files (e.g., .bib files, files containing graphical content, etc.). If the list of references is submitted using a .bib file, then please also submit a MS Word version of the list. Regardless of the format used, the author must submit a separate PDF version of the manuscript. The contents of the PDF version must be identical to the MS Word or LaTeX version of the manuscript.

> The use of figures to demonstrate an argument or illustrate a finding is strongly encouraged. Authors should ensure that the graphical content of any figures is legible and of high quality. The use of color should be minimized, as it cannot be included in the print version of the AJPS. Color figures are retained in the online version.

> For purposes of review, authors are encouraged to insert figures and tables into the body of the text, thereby enabling referees to refer to the material easily while reading the manuscript. Regardless of whether they are inserted in the text or left at the end of the manuscript, tables and figures should be numbered consecutively.

> The use of asterisks or other symbols to represent varying levels of statistical significance is strongly discouraged. Authors who report that results are “statistically significant” should use the 0.05 level or lower; statistical tests using the 0.10 level are not acceptable for work submitted to the AJPS.

> All text, footnotes, and bibliographic references must be doubled-spaced and printed in a standard 12-point type font (material in figures and tables may be single-spaced). Page margins should be a minimum of one inch. All bibliographic references should provide authors’ first and last names, not the last name and first initial- e.g., Smith, John, not Smith, J.

Notes on http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/style.html?journal=jop

> Short variable name acronyms (such as the eight-character-or-less names required by some statistical software packages) should be avoided. They definitely should not be used in the text, and, in most cases, it is not too difficult to keep them out of tables/figures as well.
 
> When the variables or coefficients in a model are standardized to compare effects across variables measured in different units, the correct term is “standardized coefficients” not “betas” or “standardized betas.” In statistical nomenclature, Greek letters (like beta) are usually reserved to indicate population parameters.
 
> Tables containing coefficient estimates should include standard errors rather than z or t scores.
 
> Report all coefficients in a model. In other words, do not list only the significant coefficients from a regression model, loadings that are substantially different from zero in a factor analysis, and so on.
 
> A separate table of summary statistics for the individual variables employed in an empirical analysis should not be included in a manuscript, unless the values are relevant to the analysis in some explicit way. While this kind of information is often interesting, page constraints usually preclude its publication. Instead, authors are encouraged to make supplemental information available in an online appendix.
 
> If at all possible, tables and figures should not be longer than a single page (with possible exceptions for relatively complex, multipaneled figures).
