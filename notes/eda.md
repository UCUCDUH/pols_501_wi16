- Tukey EDA - 1972. Grpahics are comparisons to an implicit model.
- Wickham - plots and models

Hadley Wickham quote:

> Visualization can surprise you, but it doesn’t scale well.
> Modeling scales well, but it can’t surprise you.

- Doing statistics is like doing crosswords except that one cannot know for sure whether one has found the solution.

- The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never 
expected to see
