Try to organize classes as you, y'all, we.

* Live coding.

  - Show how you think through problems, and diagnose and correct misakes
  - teach by watching how instructors do things
  
* Sticky notes: 

  - pink sticky notes: completed exercise and wants it checked
  - green sticky notes: run into problem and want help.

* Minutes cards. Before each break. Take a minute to write one thing they've learn on the pink sticky, 
  and one thing they found confusing on the green one. 

* One up, one down. Alternatively give one positive, and one negative point about the day. Not repeating what had been said. 

* Learners use their own machines
* Collaborative note taking
* Pair programming
