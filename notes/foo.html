<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In a paragraph, summarize the paper. What is the question? What were the methods? What were the results?</li>
</ol>
<p>Research question and hypothesis:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Is the researcher focused on well‐defined questions?  </li>
<li>Is the question interesting and important?  </li>
<li>Are the propositions falsifiable?  </li>
<li>Has the alternative hypothesis been clearly stated?</li>
<li>Is the approach inductive, deductive, or an exercise in data mining? Is this the right structure?</li>
</ul>
<p>Research design:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Is the author attempting to identify a causal impact?  </li>
<li>Is the “cause” clear? Is there a cause/treatment/program/fist stage?</li>
<li>Is the relevant counterfactual clearly defined? Is it compelling?</li>
<li>Is the method for doing so clear and compelling? Has statistical inference been confused with causal inference?  </li>
<li>Does the research design identify a very narrow or a very general source of variation?</li>
<li>Could the question be addressed with another approach?</li>
<li>Useful trick: ask yourself, “What experiment would someone run to answer this question?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Theory/Model:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Is the theory/model clear, insightful, and appropriate?</li>
<li>Could the theory benefit from being more explicit, developed, or formal?  </li>
<li>Are there clear predictions that can be falsified? Are these predictions “risky” enough? Does the theory generate any prohibitions that can be tested?</li>
<li>Would an alternative theory/model be more appropriate?  </li>
<li>Could there be alternative models that produce similar predictions—that is, does evidence on the predictions necessarily weigh on the model or explanation?</li>
<li>Is the theory a theory, or a list of predictions?</li>
<li>Is the estimating equation clearly related to or derived from the model?  </li>
</ul>
<p>Data:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Are the data clearly described?  </li>
<li>Is the choice of data well‐suited to the question and test?  </li>
<li>Are there any worrying sources of measurement error or missing data? Are any proxies reasonable?</li>
<li>Are there sample size or power issues?  </li>
<li>Could the data sources or collection method be biased?  </li>
<li>Are there better sources of data that you would recommend?  </li>
<li>Are there types of data that should have been reported, or would have been useful or essential in the empirical analysis?  </li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical analysis:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Are the statistical techniques well suited to the problem at hand?  </li>
<li>What are the endogenous and exogenous variables?  </li>
<li>Has the paper adequately dealt with concerns about measurement error, simultaneity, omitted variables, selection, and other forms of bias and identification problems?  </li>
<li>Is there selection not just in who receives the “treatment”, but in who we observe, or who we measure?</li>
<li>Is the empirical strategy convincing?  </li>
<li>Could differencing, or the use of fixed effects, exacerbate any measurement error?</li>
<li>Did the author make any assumptions for identification (e.g. of distributions, exogeneity, etc)?  </li>
<li>Were these assumptions tested and, if not, how would you test them?  </li>
<li>Are the results demonstrated to be robust to alternative assumptions?  </li>
<li>Does the disturbance term have an interpretation, or is it just tacked on?  </li>
<li>Are the observations i.i.d., and if not, have corrections to the standard errors been made?  </li>
<li>What additional tests of the empirical strategy would you suggest for robustness and confidence in the research strategy?  </li>
<li>Are there any dangers in the empirical strategy (e.g. sensitivity to identification assumptions)?  </li>
<li>Can you imagine a better, or alternative, empirical strategy?  </li>
</ul>
<p>Results:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Do the results adequately answer the question at hand?  </li>
<li>Are the conclusions convincing? Are appropriate caveats mentioned?  </li>
<li>What variation in the data identifies the elements of the model?  </li>
<li>Are there alternative explanations for the results, and can we test for them?  </li>
<li>Could the author have taken the analysis further, to look for impact heterogeneity, for causal mechanisms, for effects on other variables, etc?</li>
<li>Is absence of evidence confused with evidence of absence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Scope:   - Can we generalize these results?   - Has the author specified the scope conditions?   - Have casual mechanisms been explored?   - Are there further types of analysis that would illuminate the external validity, or the causal mechanism at work?   - Are there other data or approaches that would complement the current one?</p>
<h1 id="replicability">Replicability</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Did they cite the sources of the data? They should provide enough information so that you can find the original data that they used; verify that by trying to find the data.</li>
<li>Are you able to run the code?</li>
<li>Did the code produce the results that were provided in the</li>
<li>Is the code clear and accessible? In particular, can you tell which parts of the code produce which tables, figures, and results.</li>

<p>How to do peer review well (https://stat545-ubc.github.io/peer-review02_peer-evaluation-guidelines.html)</p>
<ul>
<li>Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.</li>
<li>Be specific and concise.</li>
<li>Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.</li>
<li>If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evaluations-of-peer-review">Evaluations of Peer Review</h1>
<p>It’s binary. Each peer review will be deemed “good” or “needs more”.</p>
<p>Hallmarks of “needs more” feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your review is so generic that it’s hard to determine which assignment you’re reviewing.</li>
<li>Your review is mean.</li>
<li>You can’t find anything to praise/learn and yet you don’t offer any suggestions either.</li>
<li>Each review you do will get you 1 point if “good” and 0 points if “needs more”.</li>
</ul>
