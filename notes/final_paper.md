# Final Paper

The manuscript should effectively and competently use appropriate quantitative methodology to address a research problem.
Due to the limited time in this course, it is not necessary for this paper to address an important research problem or a novel contribution to the literature.
While those will not be criteria for the evaluation of this paper, the author is encouraged to pursue those, as they are what leads to publications.

Failure comply with the sylistic and formatting requirements will result in a rejection of the paper.

- The manuscript must be 15 pages or less, including figures, tables, and references, but not including the title page and abstract.
- The manuscript must be formatted in 12 point standard font (e.g. Times New Roman), doubled spaced, with 1 inch margins.
  Footnotes and references must be double spaced. Tables and Figures may be single spaced. New paragraphs should be indicated by indenting the first line.
  Do not add extra spaces between paragraphs.
- Check manuscripts for strange page breaks, widows, and orphans (the last first or last line of a paragraph at the start or end or beginning of a page), 
  and "hanging" section headings at the end of a page.
- The manuscript should be submitted as either a Microsoft Word (*.docx*) or PDF file.
- References should be included at the backs.
- The manuscript must have a title page with an abstract of 150 words or less. The abstract should provide a concise summary of (1) research topic the 
  manuscript addresses, (2) the research strategy employed for the analysis, (3) the results obtained from the analysis, and (4) the implications of the findings.
- The manuscript should contain 2--5 figures or tables. The abstract should not contain formal citations to other work.
- Pages should be numbered.
- Sections should not be numbered, instead they should be given short titles. The introduction should not be titled. In general, only one level of sections should be used, but authors may use subsections where necessary.
- Tables and figures should be inserted into the text of the manuscript at appropriate locations. Although journal submissions generally 
  discourage use of color, the author is *encouraged* to use colors in figures.
- The manuscript should follow the style guidelines from the American Political Science Association's Style Manual for Political Science (revised 2006), 
  or the Chicago Manual of Style (15th or 16th edition). These guidelines include text style, citations, appendices, notes, references, and figures/tables.
- While the main text of manuscript should be a concise summary of results, the author may submit supporting information, which serves in lieu of appendices.
  This may include descriptions of the data, alternative specifications of statistical methods, and additional tables and figures that elaborate the manuscript's primary point.
- All data and code necessary to reproduce the article's results *must* be provided.
- "The manuscript should present its content as efficiently as possible, with no unnecessary material included in the text or exhibits. For example, including a paragraph at the end of the introductory section laying out the organization of the paper is unnecessary." (AJPS)
- "The manuscript must effectively and informatively communicate its contribution to a general political science audience." (AJPS)
- The paper should be self contained
- As it is impossible for me to blind review these papers, the manuscripts should not be anonymized. 

- The use of astrisks or symbols to represent statistical significance is discouraged. Tables should include standard errors rather than $z$-scores, $t$-scores, or $p$-values.
- Authors reporting that results are "statistically significant" should use the 0.05 level or lower. Results at the 0.10 should not be referred to as "statistically significant". However, the strength of evidence necessary to justify findings cannot be captured by any single criterion, such as the conventional .05 level of statistical significance. I will evaluate the "strength of findings on a range of criteria beyond statistical significance, including substantive significance, theoretical aptness, the importance of the problem under study, and the feasibility of obtaining additional evidence." (APSR)
- Short variable name acronymns should not be used. 
- Report all coefficients in a model. Do not list only the signifiant coefficients in a regression model.
- A table of summary statistics of the variables included in the analysis should not included in the manuscript, unless the values are explicitly relevant to the analysis. 
  Instead, include it in supplemental material.
- If possible, tables and figures should not be longer than one page, though there may be exceptions, such as multipaneled figures.
