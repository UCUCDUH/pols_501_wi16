# Unifying Political Methodology Notes

Notes on King, *Unifying Political Methodology*

## Chapter 1

Language of inference

social system

: The object under study. Social systems include a government, war, market, etc.

explanatory variables

: Features of the social system, denoted $X$. The explanatory variables are usually assumed to be known *a priori*

output (dependent) variable:

: All systems generate some type of output or consequences that can be observed. This is what the researcher aims to explain.

random variables

: Assigment of numbers to events.

data

: The process by which parts of the output are chosen is *sampling*, and the data are called the *sample*. The method by which the sample was generated is central to modeling and estimation. $y$ are $n$ observed realizations.

models

: A mathematical simpilcation of and approximation to a complex social system. 
: Models are not "true" or "false", they are always approximations. 

statistical model

: A statistical model is a representation of the process by which a social system produced output.
: A statistical model consists of both a *systemic* and a *stochastic* component.

statistics

: Statistic is a function of the data. $h = h(y) = h(y_1, ..., y_n)$. Even though statistics throw away data, they are easier to model and interpret tha the whole dataset.

descriptive statistics

: Descriptive statistics are statistics that are used only to describe the data, and not as a model of the social system producing the output. 

"Description in economics, as in other sciences, plays a key role in bringing to the fore what is to be explained by theory." Zellner (1984)

"The fundamental idea of statistics is that useful information can be accrued from individual small bits of data" Efron 1982.
