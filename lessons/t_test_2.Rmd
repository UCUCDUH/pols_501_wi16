This is another example of how to perform a `t.test()` to evaluate difference in means. To do so, we need to:

  - Split the observations of a dataset into two groups depending on their values for a key independent variable.
  - Calculate the mean value of the two groups for the dependent variable.
  - Calculate upper and lower 95% confidence intervals around the two means.
  - Evaluate if they overlap.
  
In this example we'll use a dataset in the packages `car`. Install and load the package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages(car)
```

```{r}
library(car)
```

This package conatins a dataset `Prestige` with data about the professional occupation of certain individuals and the presitge of that occupation based on a survey conducted in the mid-1960s.
