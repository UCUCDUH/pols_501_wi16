# Overview

Some questions that were asked:

- Why use a <-, =, or ==?
- Why not install packages in a script? We should mention to put all library at the start?
- Snow example: Code is somewhat confusing. It may be better to show a more straightforward example of using example. Perhaps something like `seq`?
- paths in Windows - \ and unescaped characters
