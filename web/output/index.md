# Learning Objectives

This is a first course in applied data analysis and statistical inference in social science.
The topics covered in this course are data hygiene, graphical summaries of data, descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis, introduction to probability, introduction to statistical inference, statistical inference for means and proportions, and some linear regression.
Although linear regression will be introduced, but most discussion of linear regression will occur in POL S 501/CS&SS 501

The learning objectives for this course are:

- Complete a research project applying the quantitative methods used in this course.
- Recognize the relationship between social science models and statistical inference in order to evaluate and produce research.
- Understand and apply statistical inference methods for means, proportions, and linear regression.
- Interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis tests correctly.
- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
- Use statistical software (R) to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis and statistical inference.


# Prerequisites

The course is suitable for students with a large range of prior exposure to statistics and mathematics.
No prior statistical, mathematical, or programming experience is necessary beyond arithmetic, algebra, and elementary calculus.


# Evaluation

Course evaluation will consist of approximately weekly assignments, and a research project.

# Software and Computing

This course will use R. R is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis.
You can download R https://cran.r-project.org/

Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.


# Class Expectations

Students should do the readings *before* the class. Some class time will be spent on leacture, but the majority of class time consist of discussion, questions, and problem solving.

Lab sections will cover how to implement the analysis in R, conceptual review and continued elaboration of the week's material, and time for students to discuss and get feedback on their projects.


# Research Project

Every student in this class will execute their own statistical analysis of a research question, from data collection, to analysis, to presentation.
If you developed a research design for POLS 500, you may be able to use it in 501.
However you need to confirm that you will be able to assemble a dataset to test a specific research hypothesis within the time constraints of this course, because you will be using it throughout the course.
If that seems unlikely, you will need to choose a different project.
We will be discussing some additional data or research opportunities.


# Resources

There are a couple places on campus that you can go to get additional statistical conulting

- [CSSCR](http://csscr.washington.edu/consulting.html) has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, such as R. 
- [CSSS Statistical Consulting](https://www.csss.washington.edu/Consulting/) provides general statistical consulting (questions about your research project).  You can find their hours and locations on their site.
