# Research Project Assignment 2

For any data you have available, but at least one dataset, answer the following.

1. What is the source of the dataset? Be as specific as possible. It is not necessary, but for the paper you will be expected to use cite all data following the conventions that are becoming standard in the field; see the *Political Analysis* guidelines for ["Data Citation"](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/polana/for_authors/general.html).
2. Use `str` and the associated documentation of the dataset to describe the types and meanings of the variables in the dataset. You do not need to discuss all variables; only focus on those of most interest to your analysis.
3. What type of data is it: cross-section, time-series, or time-series cross-section? 
4. What is the unit of observation of the dataset? What variable(s) uniquely identify observations in the data? 
5. How many observations are there in the dataset? 
6. Use `summary()` to summarize relevent variables.
7. Which variables have missing values? How prevelant is the missingness?
8. Plot the distribution of at least one variable using **ggplot2** with either `geom_histogram` or `geom_density` with `geom_rug`. What is the shape of the distribution? 
9. Choose two variables to compare. If they are both continuous, create a scatterplot using `geom_scatter`. If they are both discrete, create a faceted bar plot using `geom_scatter` and `facet_grid`. If one is discrete and one is continuous, create a boxplot using `geom_boxplot`.

Your assignment should be submitted as either a Word document (`.docx`, `.doc`) or PDF. The document should be written in prose and not include code. However, it should include relevant plots and output that illustrate your points. Any R output should be formatted with a monospace font. All R code and data used to generate your results and support your analysis should also be turned in. All R code needs to be written so that another person can reproduce your results.
