Instructions for Jeff's office hours: 

- Sign up for a slot on Canvas using the Scheduler tab in the Calendar.
- Email me 24 hours prior to your appointment with what you would like to discuss

These instructions will ensure that our time is efficiently spent and I can be of the most help to you.

# Learning Objectives

This is a first course in applied data analysis and statistical inference in social science.
The topics covered in this course are data hygiene, graphical summaries of data, descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis, introduction to probability, introduction to statistical inference, statistical inference for means and proportions, and some linear regression.
Although linear regression will be introduced, but most discussion of linear regression will occur in POL S 501/CS&SS 501

The learning objectives for this course are:

- Complete a research project applying the quantitative methods used in this course.
- Recognize the relationship between social science models and statistical inference in order to evaluate and produce research.
- Understand and apply statistical inference methods for means, proportions, and linear regression.
- Interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis tests correctly.
- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
- Use statistical software (R) to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis and statistical inference.


# Prerequisites

The course is suitable for students with a large range of prior exposure to statistics and mathematics.
No prior statistical, mathematical, or programming experience is necessary beyond arithmetic, algebra, and elementary calculus.


# Evaluation

Course evaluation will consist of approximately weekly assignments, and a research project.

# Materials

## Textbooks 

- Gailmard, Sean. *Statistical Modeling and Inference for Social Science*. Cambridge University Press, 2014.
- Diez, David M., Christopher D Barr, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel. *OpenIntro Statistics*. 3rd ed., 2015. <https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php> (Free)
- Lander, Jared P. *R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics*. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013.


## Software and Computing

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to R. Instructions to install them are [here](/resources/install/).

Additionally, [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/), a website which provides online interactive R tutorials, will be used to teach R. 
Although it is not free, there is a [student subscription rate](https://www.datacamp.com/enroll-student).

Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.


# Class Expectations

Students should do the readings *before* the class. Some class time will be spent on lecture, but the majority of class time consist of discussion, questions, and problem solving.

Lab sections will cover how to implement the analysis in R, conceptual review and continued elaboration of the week's material, and time for students to discuss and get feedback on their projects.

# Research Project

Every student in this class will execute their own statistical analysis of a research question, from data collection, to analysis, to presentation.
If you developed a research design for POLS 500, you may be able to use it in 501.
However you need to confirm that you will be able to assemble a dataset to test a specific research hypothesis within the time constraints of this course, because you will be using it throughout the course.
If that seems unlikely, you will need to choose a different project. 

See the [schedule](/schedule/#finals-period) for the final paper due date.

# Resources

Beyond what the teaching team can providing, there are several resources on campus that you can go for assistance with data, computing, and statistical problems:

-  Center for Social Science Computing and Research ([CSSCR](http://julius.csscr.washington.edu/about/consulting.html)) has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, e.g. R. Go there for software or data related questions.
- [CSSS Statistical Consulting](https://www.csss.washington.edu/consulting) provides general statistical consulting. Go there for questions about statistical methods.
- [eScience Data Science Office Hours](http://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/)
- UW Library: [Data](http://guides.lib.uw.edu/friendly.php?s=research/data), [Political Science](http://guides.lib.uw.edu/friendly.php?s=research/polisci)
