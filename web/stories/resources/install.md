.. title: Installing Software for this course
-->

This course will require the following software, all of which is *free*

1. R. The programming language and interpreter that actually runs the code
2. RStudio. An [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), i.e. a nice interface that makes working with R much easier.

# Installing R

Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/). CRAN stands for the the Comprehensive R Archive Networks - it is what you will download R packages from.

# Installing RStudio

Rstudio is an a user-friendly interface to the R programmming language.
Download Rstudio Desktop from [rstudio.com] <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>. You want to install *Rstudio Desktop*, not Rstudio Server, which is something different.
